# CursaTetra
![alt text](readmeBanner.png)
## A terminal-bounded block-based puzzle game written in Python/Curses

This game is dedicated to Alexey Pajitnov, original author of Tetris. This version features:
* 80x24 character resolution
* Colored pieces
* Nintendo-style scoring
* Three randomizer algorithms:
	* A 7-Bag piece randomizer
	* A random.randint() shuffle (a.k.a. "true") randomizer
	* A T.G.M.-inspired randomizer
* A "ghost piece" to help guide your aim
* A high score file (JSON format)
* T-Spin detection and score reward
* The traditional 20-block high playing board

The goal is simple: rotate and move pieces as they fall, line up ten blocks in a row to clear a row, and keep going until the board tops out.

## Fixes coming soon
* Draw routine bugs introduced (most likely) by Python 3.8

## Featurs coming eventually
* Compatability with `windows-curses`

## Piece development documentation
### Piece orientations
* H : horizontal (default)
* V : vertical
* HP : horizontal, pi radians around (180 deg)
* VP : vertical, pi radians around (180 deg)
### class Piece: for active block data
* Valid Constructor Values:
	* y: [1, 19]
		* Smallest block height-wise is Square, S, and Z; All take up two cells vertically
	* x: [1, 10]
	* pID: {'C', 'S', 'Z', 'L', 'R', 'I', 'T'}
	* orient: {'', 'H', 'V', 'HP', 'VP'}
		* Null-orientation is only valid for the Square

* Methods & Valid Values:
	* draw(): Draws the piece on the board
	* undraw(): Erases the piece from the board
	* getGhostDepth(): Determines the y-position of the ghost piece
	* drawGhost(): Draws the ghost piece on the board
	* undrawGhost(): Erases the ghost piece from the board
	* getNewOrient(rotDir): Gets the new orientation for the piece based on rot. dir.
		* rotDir: {'CW', 'CCW'}
			* Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise
			* Only needed for L, R, and T pieces
	* rotate(rotDir): Rotates the piece in the indicated rot. dir.
		* rotDir: See notes in getNewOrient
	* move(direction): Moves the piece in the indicated direction
		* direction: {'L', 'R', 'D'}
			* Left, Right, or Down
	* canRotate(rotDir): Returns True if the piece can rotate in the indicated rot. dir.
		* rotDir: See notes in getNewOrient
	* canMove(direction): Returns True if the piece can move in the indicated direction
		* direction: See notes in move
### Piece designations & diagrams
#### Based on specification in Game Boy version
* Note: The orientation of the pieces may seem backwards at first glance;
Consider it in terms of the orientation of an underline
below the text character that identifies a piece

# CursaTetra
## A terminal-bounded block-based puzzle game written in Python/Curses

# Piece orientations

* H : horizontal (default)
* V : vertical
* HP : horizontal, pi radians around (180 deg)
* VP : vertical, pi radians around (180 deg)

# Piece designations & diagrams
## Based on specification in Game Boy version

* Note: The orientation of the pieces may seem backwards at first glance;
Consider it in terms of the orientation of an underline
below the text character that identifies a piece

* C : Square
